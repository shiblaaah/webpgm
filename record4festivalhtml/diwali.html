<p>Diwali, or the Festival of Lights, is a major five-day festival celebrated by Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Celebrated annually based on the Hindu lunar calendar, its name derives from "deepavali," meaning "row of lights". During Diwali, families decorate their homes with oil lamps (diyas), exchange sweets and gifts, and engage in prayers and feasts to bring joy, prosperity, and spiritual reflection into their homes and communities..</p>
