<p>Holi is an ancient Hindu festival of spring, love, and unity, celebrated primarily in India and Nepal. It is known as the "Festival of Colors" for the tradition of throwing colored powders and water on one another. Holi marks the end of winter and the arrival of spring, symbolizes the victory of good over evil, and is a time to forget past grievances and mend relationships.
